/* IDE Device custom signals:

      nIDE_WR signal goes directly to the /WR pin on both IDE interfaces.   This signal is asserted (low) as soon as     
      the CPU_RW signal goes low, which normally happens write at the start of an /AS cycle.  The IDE_WR_DELAY1 and DELAY2 
      flip flops are configured such that they both start at 0 when an AS cycle starts.  After 2 CLK_16M cycles the 
      DELAY2 signal is set to 1, which directly unasserts the IDE /WR pin.  The allows the /WR pin to have an active rising
      edge BEFORE the end of the CPU cpu cycle.  This is critical to allow the IDE interface to latch data, since at the end
      of the cycle the output buffers to the IDE inteface are turned off.  This was a fix from the original design which 
      assumed the rising edge of the write signal would be sufficienctly ahead of the buffers getting turned off.

    RTC Device custom signals 

   RTC_A_SEL is used to change the address/data select lines going to the DS Real Time Clock IC.
   It is also used to drive the DS line on the RTC.  The flip flop is reset while RTS_CS is off 
   (which is tied to /AS), and then increments to 1 on the next falling edge.  It will stay at 1
   until the end of the bus cycle.
